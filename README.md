# gropt-diffusion-pypulseq
Pypulseq Implementation of Diffusion Waveforms created with the MRI Gradient Optimization Toolbox

# Overview
These are the tools used to generate simulations and waveforms associated with this ISMRM 2024 abstract submission: 
Hannum AJ, Loecher M, Setsompop K, Ennis DB. Mitigation of Peripheral-Nerve Stimulation with Arbitrary Gradient Waveform Design for Diffusion-Weighted MRI.

This repository will continue to be updated with
