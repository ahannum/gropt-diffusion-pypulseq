# gropt-diffusion-pypulseq
Pypulseq Implementation of PNS-constrianed Diffusion Waveforms created with the MRI Gradient Optimization Toolbox (GrOpt)

# Overview
These are the tools used to generate simulations and waveforms and have been updated to streamline a script for developing .seq files to run on the system. 

This repository will continue to be updated with code to generate and assess waveforms using the MRI Gradient Optimization Toolbox and convert to Pulseq files for capabilities of generating waveforms on a scanner. 

# Works utilizing this repository
This repository was originally utilized for the following abstract submission:
